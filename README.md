# Clock UI

Clock UI is a dynamic web application designed to allow teachers to modify and preview schedules on a clock interface. It is currently designed to run on desktop computers with Windows or Mac OS.

## Getting Started

These instructions will guide you on how to get the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

To make this work you need to download the latest versions of [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download), [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads), and [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en) if you do not have it downloaded already.

### Installation

1. Open Visual Studio Code and clone the repository on a local computer.
2. Open the repository when prompted.
3. Split your terminal into three separate terminals for running the admin, client, and server respectively.
4. Run `npm update` in each terminal to install all the necessary dependencies.
5. Once the installation is complete, run `npm run dev` in the server and run `npm start` in the other two to start the application.

## Usage

Once the application is running, it will direct you to the admin website. Here, you can just modify the schedule as you need it.

## Data Storage

The application uses JSON files for data storage of the schedules.
